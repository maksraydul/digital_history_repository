# The Economic Policies of Republican Presidents over the 20th Century
## Introduction
Coming into the 20th century, Republican commercial policy was predominated by the ideologies of protectionism and reciprocity. The Republican Party had consistently called for establishing “duties upon imports” as a primary source of revenue since 1860, and reciprocal trade was considered the “twin measure” of the protective tariff.[^1] Meanwhile, Republican fiscal policy was predominantly conservative, with the party advocating against “unceasing deficit”, “borrowed money”, and excessive public debt.[^2] Over the 20th century, Republican fiscal policy remained conservative, with a primary objective of a balanced federal budget. However, Republican commercial policy notably shifted away from protective trade and toward free trade following World War II, consistent with a greater shift in economic thought and policy toward global trade liberalization.

Through the speeches and addresses of Republican presidents of the 20th century, as well as legislation passed under their administrations, this paper will demonstrate the changes, or lack thereof, in the commercial and fiscal policies of the Republican Party over the century, periodized into two sections. The first begins with the presidency of William McKinley and ends with that of Herbert Hoover and is characterized by a consistently protective trade policy and generally conservative fiscal policy, though it changed somewhat from president to president. Figure 1 shows that Republican fiscal policy was more moderate early in the century, becoming more conservative during Warren Harding’s presidency and as indicated by Figure 2, reciprocity was not always essential to the commercial policies of Republican presidents.

## McKinley to Hoover: From Prosperity to Depression
Near the end of his presidency, William McKinley believed that the United States was in “a state of unexampled prosperity”, which he attributed to his “firmly established” commercial policy.[^3] Two ideas predominated this policy: the protective tariff and reciprocal trade. Both are exemplified in the Dingley Act of 1897 that was passed during McKinley’s presidency. The act increased tariff rates on many products, averaging 47 percent annually, the highest in history at the time.[^4] The act also authorized the president to negotiate commercial agreements with other countries to secure “reciprocal and equivalent concessions”.[^5] Under the act, reciprocal agreements were negotiated with France, Germany, Portugal, Italy, and several other nations.[^6]

McKinley’s fiscal policy was strictly conservative, a reaction to the “depression in business” that immediately preceded his presidency.[^7] He advocated against “extravagance” in public expenditure and opposed all taxation except in the form of the tariff.[^8] To him, it was clear that the public favored a system of tariff taxation and was “opposed to any needless additions” to internal taxes.[^9] The only notable change to tax legislation during McKinley’s presidency was the War Revenue Act of 1898, passed to raise revenue for the ongoing Spanish-American War. While McKinley initially praised “the patriotism of Congress” in its passage of the act, he called for a reduction of the taxes it established after the war.[^10]

After McKinley was assassinated, Teddy Roosevelt became president. Roosevelt believed that “the man of great wealth owes a peculiar obligation to the state” and as such, his fiscal policy was more progressive than McKinley’s.[^11] Unlike his predecessor, he was not opposed to internal taxation, although he wished to reduce revenues more “within the limit of our actual needs”, believing that the government should manage its resources in the same way that “each of us husbands his private resources”.[^12] To Roosevelt, both rich and poor needed to be on “a basis of absolute equality”, so the purpose of tax reform should be to “distribute the burden of supporting the government more equitably”.[^13] He supported both an inheritance tax and income tax, but despite all his advocacy, there was no reform to tax legislation during his presidency.[^14]

Roosevelt’s commercial policy was a continuation of McKinley’s, but he advocated reciprocity only as subordinate to the tariff system. To him, the principle of protection had brought about “great prosperity”, but he noticed how divisive the tariff issue was to his party and thus felt that the Dingley tariff “could not with wisdom be changed”.[^15] He advocated a “supplementary system of reciprocal benefit”, which would maintain prosperity so long as reciprocity, “the handmaiden of protection”, was used to readjust the tariff.[^16] Roosevelt claimed reciprocal treaties would not only “widen our markets” but naturally adjust tariff rates “in practical shape”, and he successfully negotiated such a treaty with Cuba.[^17]

Roosevelt’s successor, William Taft, continued with a protective and reciprocal commercial policy. Taft envisioned a “reciprocal dependence of the countries of the Western Hemisphere” and partially accomplished that when his administration reached a trade agreement with Canada.[^18] He was a self-proclaimed “tariff revisionist”, believing that many rates of the Dingley tariff had “become excessive”, and so he opposed the “standpatter” Republicans who supported high rates.[^19] Soon after his inauguration, Taft called a special session of Congress to revise the tariff law and less than half a year later, Congress passed the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act.[^20] The act ended up a compromise bill that decreased 650 rates while increasing 220 and leaving 1,150 unaltered, and it notably terminated any trade agreements established under the Dingley Act.[^21]

Taft’s fiscal policy was more progressive than McKinley’s but less so than Roosevelt’s. He believed that those responsible for expenditure have an obligation “to be as economical as possible” but large expenditures were necessary “to make the government effective”.[^22] He advocated a federal income tax but knew that “the decision of the Supreme Court” indicated it would strike down any bill establishing such a tax.[^23] Regardless, Taft proposed an amendment to the Constitution that would overwrite the ruling of the court and near the end of his presidency, the states ratified the Sixteenth Amendment, which empowered Congress to levy an income tax.[^24]

Roosevelt notably perceived Taft’s policies as too conservative, and he left the party to form his own Progressive Party. This schism ensured the Democratic victories in the 1912 elections, and Woodrow Wilson became president. Through the government trifecta, he began implementing his New Freedom program, which included the Revenue Act of 1913. The act decreased tariff rates, limited the president’s ability to negotiate trade agreements, and established a federal income tax.[^25] With the outbreak of World War I came an economic boom that was followed by a post-war recession.

Warren Harding was elected president amid the recession and so his fiscal and commercial policies were more conservative. Harding opposed the “false economics” of the Wilson administration, rejecting the “theory of banished barriers of trade”.[^26] He called for reducing both “abnormal expenditures” and war taxes, analogizing resolving these issues to “putting our public household in order”.[^27] He sought to repeal any “unproductive” internal taxes and urged for revisions to the Revenue Act of 1913.[^28] Early into his presidency, Harding called a special session of Congress to deal with these “urgent national problems”, and the Emergency Tariff of 1921 was soon passed, which increased rates on many agricultural products.[^29] Congress later passed the Revenue Act of 1921, which repealed the excess profits tax and reduced the top marginal rate from 73 percent to 58.[^30] The emergency tariff was later overwritten by the “permanent” Fordney-McCumber tariff in 1922 that notably contained a provision “for a certain flexibility in customs duties” which enabled the president to adjust tariff rates.[^31]

After Harding’s untimely death, Calvin Coolidge was elected president, and his fiscal and commercial policy can be best described as laissez-faire. To Coolidge, taxation granted the government “the power to destroy” and any taxes that did not directly contribute to the public welfare were “a species of legalized larceny”.[^32] He advocated “a system of rigid economy in public expenditure” to reduce taxes and retire the national debt.[^33] Multiple revenue acts were passed during his presidency, and from 1921 to 1928, the total debt was reduced from $26 and a half billion to just over $17 billion.[^34] Most exemplifying Coolidge’s laissez-faire ideology was his position on tariff reform, in that he believed “constant revision of the tariff… is disturbing and harmful”.[^35] To him, the Fordney-McCumber tariff, through its “elastic provision” that empowered the president, was sufficient to maintain prosperity and should remain unaltered.[^36]

Coolidge did not run for reelection and Herbert Hoover was elected president. The majority of Hoover’s presidency was plagued by the Great Depression. Hoover initially perceived the economic crisis as mainly “a psychological situation”, the solution to which was not direct government intervention but rather simply giving “confidence to the public that the business fabric” was fixing itself.[^37] He issued many messages to assuage the fears of the American people, assuring that business was “on a sound and prosperous basis” and claiming that the “stock market phenomenon” was isolated.[^38] As the Depression continued, Hoover took a more direct stance on recovery, which first required the “financial stability of the United States government”.[^39] At the beginning of the Depression, Hoover thought it was necessary to decrease the surplus of revenues by reducing income tax rates and he called for “relief from our continuously mounting expenditures”.[^40] By 1931 however, the Depression had brought about a “heavy decrease in tax receipts” and an “increase in expenditure” on various aid, resulting in a budget deficit.[^41] Hoover reversed his fiscal policy, calling for “a temporary increase in taxes” and urging to “partially finance the deficit by borrowing”.[^42]

Hoover’s commercial policy was initially influenced by the ongoing “difficulties of the agricultural industry”, and he called a special session of Congress to enact immediate farm relief.[^43] To him, there was a multitude of solutions to this “great number of problems”, one of which was “an effective tariff upon agricultural products”.[^44] Hoover praised the Fordney-McCumber act and its “principle of the flexible tariff” but felt that economic changes since its enactment necessitated changes to the law.[^45] He advocated the Tariff Commission to play a greater role in altering tariff law and opposed “any general congressional revision of the tariff”.[^46] The special session of Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which increased tariff rates on thousands of products and removed from the president the power of altering tariff rates.[^47] Instead, the Tariff Commission was now empowered to investigate “the tariff relations” and commercial treaties with other countries and to readjust rates based on that.[^48]

Hoover’s failure to deal with the Great Depression led to FDR winning the presidency and the Democratic Party winning the Congress in the 1932 elections. The Democratic government trifecta began implementing FDR’s New Deal, a series of programs and policies designed to relieve the unemployed, recover the economy, and reform the financial system. As FDR continued to run for reelection, Republican economic policy shifted almost entirely toward opposing the New Deal. FDR and the New Deal were criticized by various Republican candidates as “arbitrary and uncertain”, having “distorted” liberalism, or a “one-man government”.[^49]

## Eisenhower to Bush: Free Trade and Fiscal Conservatism
FDR died shortly after his fourth inauguration and was succeeded by Harry Truman. Truman’s presidency saw the end of World War II and the beginning of the Cold War, and the Western world experienced a period of economic prosperity characterized by “unprecedented growth of international trade [and] the global economy”.[^50] With this came a shift in mainstream economic thought toward global trade liberalization, exemplified by the 1948 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that the United States signed, with its objective to eliminate trade barriers and other “discriminatory treatment in international commerce”.[^51] Republican commercial policy changed with this notable shift, moving away from protective trade toward free trade, focused on establishing a reciprocal and mutual global economy by removing trade barriers such as tariffs. However, Republican fiscal policy during this time remained similarly conservative, though controlling inflation was now a priority.

Dwight Eisenhower’s commercial policy reflected the significant shift in economic thought. Eisenhower declared that his administration would “recognize the importance of profitable and equitable world trade” and he called for Congress to extend the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act that was passed under FDR in 1934.[^52] An amendment to the Smoot-Hawley tariff, the act reestablished the presidential power to negotiate reciprocal commercial agreements.[^53] Eisenhower criticized “arbitrary restraints on trade” such as tariffs and believed that free, mutual trade would “lay the groundwork for peace”.[^54] He advocated reducing tariff rates, also urging other nations to reciprocally lower their rates so that everyone “may move steadily toward greater economic advantage”.[^55]

Despite the shift in trade policy, Eisenhower’s fiscal policy remained conservative. The “essential first measure” of his policy was a balanced budget, which he believed was the key to keeping inflation in check.[^56] To achieve this balance, it was necessary to reduce both expenditures and taxes, but Eisenhower prioritized the former over the latter. To him, it was important to “determine the extent to which expenditures can be reduced” before reducing taxes, and any tax reductions made would be “justified only because of” any reductions already made in expenditures.[^57] Eisenhower also called for a complete overhaul of the tax system to resolve “glaring tax inequities”.[^58]

John Fitzgerald Kennedy (JFK) was elected president after Eisenhower, and after his assassination, Lyndon Johnson succeeded him. Keynesianism predominated the economic policies of the JFK and Johnson administrations. In 1962, Congress passed the Trade Expansion Act to encourage trade agreements and an “open and nondiscriminatory” global economy, and the act reestablished the presidential authority to adjust tariff rates.[^59] Both Kennedy and Johnson advocated decreasing taxes, and the Revenue Act of 1964 passed under Johnson reduced income and corporate tax rates.[^60] However, the onset of the Vietnam War as well as Johnson’s Great Society programs ultimately resulted in increased inflation and a growing deficit.

Johnson ran for reelection and lost to Richard Nixon. In reaction to the high inflation and deficit, the primary objectives of Nixon’s fiscal policy were “to hold down taxes” and “to continue controlling inflation”, and like in Eisenhower’s policy, expenditure reform needed to precede taxation reform.[^61] Nixon opposed excessive government spending because he believed that the government spent not its own money but rather taxpayers’ money, and he recommended “an overall spending ceiling for each fiscal year” so that taxpayers’ money would be handled responsibly.[^62] On taxation, Nixon specifically called for “holding the line” on income taxes and reducing the “soaring” property taxes that threatened “both our communities and our schools”.[^63]

Nixon’s commercial policy was clearly a continuation of Eisenhower’s with its primary objective “to encourage foreign trade”.[^64] Despite the oil crisis that plagued the first year of his presidency, he knew that the world had turned “from an era of confrontation to an era of negotiation”, the answer to which was “not to build a wall around America but rather” to maintain competition.[^65] Nixon advocated a “more open world trading system” that would give American products “a fairer shake”.[^66] ADDMORE.

Nixon resigned from office due to the Watergate scandal, and Gerald Ford became president through provisions of the 25th Amendment. At first, the objective of Ford’s fiscal policy was to “whip inflation now”, but later unemployment became another goal of his “economic efforts”.[^67] Ford attributed inflation to “many years of enacting expensive programs” that there were no revenues for and thus concluded that “we need additional tax revenues”.[^68] He proposed an “inflation-fighting tax” in the form of a temporary surtax “of 5 percent on corporate and upper-level individual incomes” and, like Nixon before him, he advocated setting “a target spending limit” on the annual federal budget.[^69] Ford later consistently called for income tax reductions “to bolster business and industry and to create new jobs” in the form of rebates, investments, and other compensation, as well as for corporate tax reduction “to stimulate investment”. [^70] Ford’s commercial policy remained unchanged from Nixon’s, viewing the United States as part of “a world economy that is global and interdependent” and having a unique responsibility to “seek policies which complement… the constructive efforts of others”.[^71]

Having “seen the benefits of free trade and lived through the disasters of protectionism”, Ronald Reagan committed his commercial policy “to dialogue, deterrence, and promoting prosperity” through free trade.[^72] Reagan did not “apologize for America’s wealth”, which he took as evidence of “the strength of the free marketplace system”.[^73] To him, “America’s growth and future” were dependent on trade and so he sought to increase “the openness of our trading system” to enable an “increased flow of American goods, services, and investments”.[^74] Reagan envisioned a Western Hemisphere united by “a bond of mutually beneficial exchange” and believed that in a free global market, the United States could “outproduce, outcompete, and outsell anybody, anywhere in the world”.[^75] He called for “adequate export financing” and removing trade barriers, and he established “the historic free trade agreement between” the United States and Canada in 1987.[^76]

Coming into office amid the recessions of the early 1980s, Reagan’s fiscal policy was focused on reducing the “two years of back-to-back double-digit inflation” through supply-side economics.[^77] Adhering to supply-side theories, Reagan defined inflation as “too much money chasing too few goods” and claimed that the government had “only two ways of getting money other than raising taxes”, borrowing or printing, both of which were inflationary.[^78] He attributed the “source of our economic problems” to high taxes and questioned the government’s “presumptive right to spend and spend and spend”.[^79] Reagan notably inverted his predecessors’ policy that expenditure reform must precede taxation reform, claiming that “we can lecture our children about extravagance… Or we can cure their extravagance by simply reducing their allowance”.[^80] To him, reducing taxes would “ensure a steady decline in deficits… toward a balanced budget”.[^81]

George Bush had two objectives with his fiscal policy: “getting our own house in order” and then “paying off the national debt”.[^82] To Bush, high taxes and “wasteful government spending” were obstacles to economic growth, and he notably promised that there would be “no new taxes” imposed during his presidency, which was ultimately untrue.[^83] For decreasing the debt, he advocated “enforceable spending caps” along with “a pay-as-you-go plan” which would limit spending growth to below the inflation rate.[^84] Bush’s commercial policy ADDMORE.
