# The Economic Policies of Republican Presidents and Presidential Candidates over the 20th Century
## Introduction

  Coming into the 20th century, Republican commercial policy was predominated by the ideologies of protectionism and reciprocity. The Republican Party had consistently called for establishing “duties upon imports” as a primary source of revenue since 1860, and reciprocal trade EXPLAIN was considered the “twin measure” of the protective tariff.[^1] Meanwhile, Republican fiscal policy was predominantly conservative, with the party advocating against “unceasing deficit”, “borrowed money”, and excessive public debt.[^2] Over the 20th century, Republican fiscal policy remained conservative, with a primary objective of a balanced federal budget. However, Republican commercial policy notably shifted away from protective trade and toward free trade following World War II, consistent with a greater shift in economic thought and policy toward global trade liberalization.
  
  Through the speeches and addresses of Republican presidents of the 20th century, as well as legislation passed under their administrations, this paper will demonstrate the changes, or lack thereof, in the fiscal and commercial policies of the Republican Party over the century, periodized into two sections. The first section begins with the presidency of William McKinley and ends with that of Herbert Hoover and is characterized by a protective and reciprocal trade policy and generally conservative fiscal policy.

## McKinley to Taft: Protection, Reciprocity, and Prosperity

  Near the end of his presidency, William McKinley believed that the United States was in “a state of unexampled prosperity”, which he attributed to his “firmly established” commercial policy.[^4] Two ideas predominated this policy: the protective tariff and reciprocal trade. Both are exemplified in the Dingley Act of 1897 that was passed during McKinley’s presidency. The act increased tariff rates on many products, averaging 47 percent annually, the highest in history at the time.[^5] The act also authorized the president to negotiate commercial agreements with other countries to secure “reciprocal and equivalent concessions”.[^6] Under the act, reciprocal agreements were negotiated with France, Germany, Portugal, Italy, and several other nations.[^7]

  McKinley’s fiscal policy was strictly conservative, a reaction to the “depression in business” that immediately preceded his presidency.[^8] He advocated against “extravagance” in public expenditure and opposed all taxation except in the form of the tariff.[^9] To him, it was clear that the public favored a system of tariff taxation and was “opposed to any needless additions” to internal taxes.[^10] The only notable change to tax legislation during McKinley’s presidency was the War Revenue Act of 1898, passed to raise revenue for the ongoing Spanish-American War.[^11] While McKinley initially praised “the patriotism of Congress” in its passage of the act, he called for a reduction of the taxes it established after the war.[^12]

  After McKinley was assassinated, Teddy Roosevelt became president. Roosevelt believed that “the man of great wealth owes a peculiar obligation to the state” and as such, his fiscal policy was more progressive than McKinley’s.[^13] Unlike his predecessor, he was not opposed to internal taxation, although he wished to reduce revenues more “within the limit of our actual needs”[^14], believing that the government should manage its resources in the same way that “each of us husbands his private resources”.[^17] To Roosevelt, both rich and poor needed to be on “a basis of absolute equality”, so the purpose of tax reform should be to “distribute the burden of supporting the government more equitably”.[^15] He supported both an inheritance tax and income tax, but despite all his advocacy, there was no reform to tax legislation during his presidency.[^16]

  Roosevelt’s commercial policy was a continuation of McKinley’s, but he advocated reciprocity only as subordinate to the tariff system. To him, the principle of protection had brought about “great prosperity”[^18], but he noticed how divisive the tariff issue was to his party and thus felt that the Dingley tariff “could not with wisdom be changed”.[^19] Reciprocity, “the handmaiden of protection”, was the solution to readjusting the tariff.[^20] Roosevelt claimed that reciprocal treaties would not only “widen our markets” but also naturally adjust tariff rates “in practical shape”.[^21] Adding a “supplementary system of reciprocal benefit” would stabilize the economy, and Roosevelt FIND example of agreement. [^22]

  Roosevelt’s successor, William Taft, continued with a protective and reciprocal commercial policy. Taft envisioned a “reciprocal dependence of the countries of the Western Hemisphere” and partially accomplished that when his administration reached a trade agreement with Canada.[^26] He was a self-proclaimed “tariff revisionist”, believing that many rates of the Dingley tariff had “become excessive”, and so he opposed the “standpatter” Republicans who supported high rates.[^24] Soon after his inauguration, Taft called a special session of Congress to revise the tariff law and less than half a year later, Congress passed the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act.[^27] The act ended up a compromise bill that decreased 650 rates while increasing 220 and leaving 1,150 unaltered, and it notably terminated any trade agreements established under the Dingley Act.[^28]
 
 Taft’s fiscal policy was more progressive than McKinley’s but less so than Roosevelt’s. He believed that those responsible for expenditure have an obligation “to be as economical as possible”[^29] but large expenditures were necessary “to make the government effective”.[^30] He advocated a federal income tax but knew that “the decision of the Supreme Court” indicated it would strike down any bill establishing such a tax.[^31] Regardless, Taft proposed an amendment to the Constitution that would overwrite the ruling of the court and near the end of his presidency, the states ratified the Sixteenth Amendment, which empowered Congress to levy an income tax.[^32]

  Roosevelt notably perceived Taft’s policies as too conservative, and he left the party to form his own Progressive Party. This schism ensured the Democratic victories in the 1912 elections, and Woodrow Wilson became president. Through the government trifecta, he began implementing his New Freedom program, which included the Revenue Act of 1913. The act decreased tariff rates, limited the president’s ability to negotiate trade agreements, and established a federal income tax.[^33] With the outbreak of World War I came an economic boom that was followed by a post-war recession.

## Harding to Hoover: 

  Warren Harding was elected president amid the recession and his fiscal and commercial policies were typical of the Republican party at that time. Harding opposed the “false economics” of the Wilson administration, rejecting the “theory of banished barriers of trade”.[^34] He called for reducing both “abnormal expenditures” and war taxes, analogizing resolving these issues to “putting our public household in order”.[^35] He sought to repeal any “unproductive” internal taxes and urged for revisions to the Revenue Act of 1913.[^36] Early into his presidency, Harding called a special session of Congress to deal with these “urgent national problems”, and the Emergency Tariff of 1921 was soon passed, which increased rates on many agricultural products.[^37] Congress later passed the Revenue Act of 1921, which repealed the excess profits tax and reduced the top marginal rate from 73 percent to 58.[^38] The emergency tariff was later overwritten by the “permanent” Fordney-McCumber tariff in 1922 that notably contained a provision “for a certain flexibility in customs duties” which enabled the president to adjust tariff rates.[^39]

  After Harding’s untimely death, Calvin Coolidge was elected president, and his fiscal and commercial policy can be best described as laissez-faire. To Coolidge, taxation granted the government “the power to destroy” and any taxes that did not directly contribute to the public welfare were “a species of legalized larceny”.[^40] He advocated “a system of rigid economy in public expenditure” to reduce taxes and retire the national debt.[^41] Multiple revenue acts were passed during his presidency, each of which reformed and reduced various taxes. From 1921 to 1928, the total debt was reduced from $26 and a half billion to just over $17 billion.[^42] Most exemplifying Coolidge’s laissez-faire ideology was his position on tariff reform, in that he believed “constant revision of the tariff… is disturbing and harmful”.[^43] To him, the Fordney-McCumber tariff, through its “elastic provision” that empowered the president, was sufficient to maintain prosperity and should remain unaltered.[^44]

  Coolidge did not run for reelection and Herbert Hoover was elected president. The majority of Hoover’s presidency was plagued by the Great Depression. Hoover initially perceived the economic crisis as mainly “a psychological situation”, the solution to which was not direct government intervention but rather simply giving “confidence to the public that the business fabric” was fixing itself.[^45] He issued many messages to assuage the fears of the American people, assuring that business was “on a sound and prosperous basis” and claiming that the “stock market phenomenon” was isolated.[^46] As the Depression continued, Hoover took a more direct stance on recovery, which first required the “financial stability of the United States government”.[^47] At the beginning of the Depression, Hoover thought it was necessary to decrease the surplus of revenues by reducing income tax rates and he called for “relief from our continuously mounting expenditures”.[^48] By 1931 however, the Depression had brought about a “heavy decrease in tax receipts” and an “increase in expenditure” on various aid, resulting in a budget deficit.[^49] Hoover reversed his fiscal policy, calling for “a temporary increase in taxes” and urging to “partially finance the deficit by borrowing”.[^50]

  Hoover’s commercial policy was initially influenced by the ongoing “difficulties of the agricultural industry”, and he called a special session of Congress to enact immediate farm relief.[^51] To him, there was a multitude of solutions to this “great number of problems”, one of which was “an effective tariff upon agricultural products”.[^52] Hoover praised the Fordney-McCumber act and its “principle of the flexible tariff” but felt that economic changes since its enactment necessitated changes to the law.[^53] He advocated the Tariff Commission to play a greater role in altering tariff law and opposed “any general congressional revision of the tariff”.[^54] The special session of Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which increased tariff rates on thousands of products and removed from the president the power of altering tariff rates. Instead, the Tariff Commission was now empowered to investigate “the tariff relations” and commercial treaties with other countries and to readjust rates based on that.[^55]

  Hoover’s failure to deal with the Great Depression led to FDR winning the presidency and the Democratic Party winning the Congress in the 1932 elections. The Democratic government trifecta began implementing FDR’s New Deal, a series of programs and policies designed to relieve the unemployed, recover the economy, and reform the financial system.[^56] As FDR continued to run for reelection, Republican economic policy shifted almost entirely toward opposing the New Deal. FDR and the New Deal were criticized by various Republican candidates as “arbitrary and uncertain”, having “distorted” liberalism, or a “one-man government”.[^57]
